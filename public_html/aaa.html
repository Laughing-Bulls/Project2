        <br><br>AAA testing stands for:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>ARRANGE - Setup and initialize the test</li>
            <li>ACT - Take the required actions that are being tested</li>
            <li>ASSERT - Verify the output</li>
        </ul>

<div class="wrapperbox">
    <div class="box h">Your testing procedure determines if a program’s behavior functions as intended. There are
        several different kinds of tests: unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests.
    </div>
</div>
<div class="wrapperbox">
    <div class="box h">Unit testing means testing individual components. It checks that individual parts are working as
        intended. A unit is the smallest possible component of software that can be tested.

    </div>
</div>
<div class="wrapperbox">
    <div class="box h">Automated tests are preferred as they are faster and more accurate, but manual tests can also be
        conducted. Automated unit testing involves writing code in the application to test the function.

            Acceptance Criteria
        </h1>
        <img src="images/accept.jpg" alt="jpg image of a the word accept">

        <br><br> Acceptance criteria includes details like:<br>
        <ul>
            <li>User experience</li>
            <li>The current user story’s effect on existing feature</li>
            <li>A key performance like speed</li>
            <li>What the user story was intended to do</li>
        </ul>

<div class="wrapperbox">
    <div class="box h">Acceptance Criteria is useful for:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Defining Boundaries: </b>Acceptance criteria help teams define boundaries of a user story. You can
                confirm the application functions as desired, meaning that a user story is completed.
            </li>
            <li><b>Reaching Consensus: </b>Acceptance criteria synchronizes the development team with the client. The
                team knows what conditions should be met, and the client knows what to expect.
            </li>
            <li><b>Basis for Testing: </b>Acceptance criteria is a cornerstone of positive and negative testing to see
                if a program works as expected.
            </li>
            <li><b>Planning and Estimation: </b>Acceptance criteria scenarios allow for the division of user stories
                into tasks so user stories can be planned.
            </li>

        <p>
            When running python programs, you can use datasets for testing. Python has various modules to help importing
            the external data in various file formats. Using a “faker” library or create your own csv file and Import
            it. A csv module enables you to read each row of a file using a comma as a delimiter. Open the file in read
            only mode and then assign the delimiter. Finally use a for loop to read each row from the csv file.
            Installing pandas can give you a robust tool for reading and writing data files.

    <div class="box h">These Factors Make a Good Unit Test:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Easy to Write: </b>You’ll write lots of unit tests to cover different cases, so it should be easy to
                code all of those test routines.
            </li>
            <li><b>Easy to Read: </b>The intent of a test should be clear. It should be easy to understand which
                scenario is being tested and if the test fails, how to address the problem.
            </li>
            <li><b>Fast: </b>You will repeatedly run them and check that no bugs have been introduced. A slow test may
                make you skip it or run it less frequently.
            </li>
            <li><b>Reliable: </b>Unit tests should fail only if there’s a bug in the code being tested. Good unit tests
                should be reproducible and independent from external factors such as the environment.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="box h">Writing testable code requires discipline, concentration, and effort. But software development is
        a complex activity, and you should be careful, and avoid throwing together new code from the top of your head.
    </div>
</div>


<div class="wrapperbox">
    <div class="box c">Testing enforces a degree of discipline when you write your code. You have to think clearly about
        the steps your test will perform. This will help you write good code, in addition to testing the final product.
