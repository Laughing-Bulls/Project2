                This programming principle helps usability by putting lower level elements below the higher level
                mechanism for using them. This not only helps readability, but it can facilitate code changes if a
                base-level operation (like one from an external library) changes. An abstract method is declared, but
                has no implementation. It uses the keyword @abstractmethod above the def line. An abstract class
                contains only abstract methods. In Python, use the abc (abstract base class) module to define abstract
                classes. They are not instantiated, and are more of a template for other classes. Classes can inherit
                from an abstract class, and an abstract method can be used as a blueprint to create methods for child
                classes.

                This refers to the concept of combining related methods and attributes. Related data and methods are
                contained within a class, perhaps with restrictions on accessing the variables and methods. For example,
                an object can keep its state private, within its class. By creating such a capsule, changes can be
                better controlled, making code safer and easier to debug. A “private variable” can avoid accidental
                change by only accessing it through that object’s methods. Other objects can only call the methods from
                that class.

                This refers to the technique of putting classes into parent-child relationships. This is a useful way to
                reuse code and save programming time. A child “inherits” its parent’s methods, but the parent does not
                inherit methods from the child. This allows a programmer to change the parent’s code, and the children
                will inherit those changes. It is also possible for the child class to revise an inherited method,
                without influencing the parent’s method. A parent class is sometimes called a “super-class”, and a child
                is sometimes called a “sub-class”. When programming, it is preferred to only use one layer of
                inheritance, and not create a “grandchild” class.

                <p>In the calculator program, you can recognize inheritance in the “Addition” class statement because
                    the Parent (“Calculation”) is referenced in the Child’s parentheses: i.e.,
                    ChildClass(ParentClass). </p>

                This refers to the concept of being able to perform an operation on multiple types of items. This may
                mean that a function behaves differently, depending on the data type. A generic function is a type of
                polymorphism. For example, the “plus” sign adds numbers, but concatenates strings. It can be useful when
                you want to call a method without worrying about which class type the object is. Since a child class can
                modify a method inherited from its parent class, it can adapt the method to the type of data used by the
                child class. You can also write a function that adapts itself to different object types.
