    <div class="box d">A glossary of terms related to Object Oriented Programming in Python</div>
    <div class="box h">
        <dl>
            <dt>Attribute
            <dd>A variable associated with an object. It is depicted as “object.attribute”. Attributes are described by
                data variables, for example: name, age, height, and weight for the object "patient".</dd>
            <dt>Class
            <dd>A data type to create and organize data into objects. It can be thought of as a blueprint.</dd>
            <dt>Class Method
            <dd>A method associated with a class, rather than an object. It is designated with @classmethod before the
                def statement, and its first parameter is “cls”. You can call a class method without instantiating an
                object. It can modify a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class. For example,
                it can modify a class variable that will be applicable to all the instances.</dd>
            <dt>Constructor
            <dd>A function that creates a new object by calling the class name. You normally use it to initialize all
                the variables. An example is the __init__() function, which is called when a new object of that class is
                instantiated.</dd>
            <dt>Data Type
            <dd>The classification of data items or to put a data value into a category. Python is a dynamically typed
                language, so you do not need to define the type of variable while declaring it.</dd>
            <dt>Design Patterns
            <dd>See: <a href="oop.html">Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction</a></dd>
            <dt>Facade
            <dd>A structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to other interfaces, abstractions and
                implementations. Facades hide complexity and provide a simple interface to the user.</dd>
            <dt>Factory
            <dd>A class that is responsible for creating objects of other types. Typically, the factory has an object
                and methods associated with it. The method is called with certain parameters, and objects are returned
                by the factory.</dd>
            <dt>Fixture
            <dd>Functions that run before each test method to which it is applied. Fixtures can feed data to the teststo
                avoid repeating code for every test. A fixture function can pass data to each test before executing the
                tests.</dd>
            <dt>Instantiation
            <dd>The creation of the instance of a new object. (An object is also called an instance of a class.) You can
                use it to set the initial values of attributes.</dd>
            <dt>Method
            <dd>Functions that are associated with class objects. Its first parameter is always “self”.</dd>
            <dt>Namespace
            <dd>Classes create namespaces where all of its attributes are defined. The Python interpreter creates a new
                namespace whenever a function executes. That namespace is local to the function and remains in existence
                until the function is completed.</dd>
            <dt>Object Oriented Programming
            <dd>A methodology of organizing code into classes, to group variables and functions into new data types. It
                breaks the program into small chunks of manageable parts.</dd>
            <dt>Objects
            <dd>Also called instances, a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data.</dd>
            <dt>Property
            <dd>Properties are special kinds of attributes that have getter, setter and delete methods, like __get__,
                __set__ and __delete__ .</dd>
            <dt>Static Method
            <dd>Like a function, it doesn’t use the attributes of a class or its objects. It is designated with
                @staticmethod before the def statement. It does not have a first parameter like “self” or “cls”. You can
                use static methods to create utility functions.</dd>
            <dt>Type Cast
            <dd>A method used to change variables / values declared in a certain data type into a different data type to
                conform to the operation to be performed. This feature can be accomplished by using constructor
                functions like int(), string(), or float().</dd>
            <dt>Type Conversion
            <dd>The process of converting the value of one data type (integer, string, float, etc.) into another data
                type. Python has two types of type conversion: implicit and explicit.</dd>
            <dt>Type Hint
            <dd>The formal solution to statically indicate the type of a value within Python code. It gives developers a
                way to make code as self-describing as possible. Add a colon and a data type after each function
                parameter where needed.</dd>
            <dt>Unit Test
            <dd>A unit is a specific piece of code to be tested, such as a function or a class. Unit tests are code that
                tests that code unit with a range of different inputs, including boundary and edge cases.</dd>
